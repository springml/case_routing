<p>How do I ask a question so that it becomes frequently asked?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Don&#8217;t you hate FAQs that are not based on anything anyone&#8217;s ever asked?
To ask, post to <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/music21list">http://groups.google.com/group/music21list</a>.
But first read what we&#8217;ve already come up with below.</div></blockquote>
<p>Why is it called <cite>music21</cite>?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><cite>music21</cite> gets its name from the fact that it was (mainly) created at
MIT in the Music and Theater Arts Section there.  At MIT, everything
has a number, and the department number for music is 21M.  There&#8217;s
no connection to &#8220;Twenty-first century&#8221; etc. and therefore superior
to older software. In fact, if I had thought of that mental connection
I probably would have come up with a different name.</p>
<p>There was a tradition early on of naming software that dealt with
music, with &#8220;MUSIC&#8221; followed by a number (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC-N">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC-N</a>).
There is famously Max Matthews&#8217;
MUSIC II, III, and IV (the sequels to just plain &#8220;MUSIC&#8221;),
MUSIC V (Matthews and Miller),
MUSIC 360 and MUSIC 11 (Vercoe et al., which became CSound).
These systems were originally created to synthesize sound digitally
though their successor systems can do quite a number of different things.</p>
<p>I figured that since no one had actually released a piece of software
in over 35 years that actually followed the &#8220;Music N&#8221; naming structure,
it was fair game to think of it not as the paradigmatic name for a
software synthesis package, but for any new or original usage of software
and music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty tickled that the new naming convention is getting an hommage
in Anas Ghrab&#8217;s music22 package: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/music22">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/music22</a></p>

<p>What is the native <cite>music21</cite> data format?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Quick answer: There is none, but it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Longer answer: <cite>music21</cite> is a toolkit for the manipulation and analysis of data
that you already have or are generating on the fly. As such, its strength is its (and python&#8217;s)
ability to work with many common formats and easy extensibility to work with many more.
You will find that for the most part you will not need to preserve your
<cite>music21</cite> data in an interchangeable format. And the number of things you can do
with <cite>music21</cite> makes it impossible for us to create formats for every possible use.
We work with <cite>music21</cite> all the time for our work and have never needed one.</p>
<p>But if you must store your <cite>music21</cite> data somehow, here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For data that can quickly and exactly be recreated,
use the script that generates as your data storage.
Then just rerun the script to get your data back.</li>
<li>For storing music notation, musicXML output will work well for many purposes.
If you just want to store an
audio file or graphic of your output, MIDI or Lilypond-&gt;PNG could work.</li>
<li>For data that cannot easily be recreated (because it&#8217;s computationally expensive to create, or
relies on user input, or is stochastically generated),
Python&#8217;s pickle or cPickle packages will allow you
to store your data on disk.  These files cannot necessarily
be read in by a later version of <cite>music21</cite>
(This is the reverse of the problem Finale has,
where you can only read older versions of files), so it
should not be used for long term storage and sharing.
Run <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">setupSerializationScaffold()</span></code> and
<code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">teardownSerializationScaffold()</span></code>
before running <cite>pickle.dump(yourStream)</cite> and
after running <cite>pickle.load(yourStream)</cite>
respectively and almost everything will be preserved.</li>
<li>For data that cannot easily be recreated but needs long-term storage and sharing,
try saving the relevant
parts of the data in an XML, json, or even CSV(!) format.
See plistlib <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/plistlib.html">http://docs.python.org/dev/library/plistlib.html</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440595">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440595</a>. You cannot store every
element of python&#8217;s object structure,
but you should easily be able to store the parts that are difficult to recreate.
<cite>Music21</cite> has some facility for a JSON storage of Streams, but it is not complete.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re programming data structures too complex to be encapsulated
in one of the solutions above,
you should have enough experience to create a data storage format of your own.
Please consider contributing
your solution to improve the package.</li>

<p>Can I synthesize new sounds with <cite>music21</cite>?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Yes, and no.  <cite>Music21</cite> is primarily built for manipulating symbolic
musical data not sound waves.  There are lots of great programs for
doing that.  But the symbolic data, however, be used as data within
a large variety of synthesis packages. So you could create new
<cite>music21</cite> objects that control the synthesis package of your choosing.</div></blockquote>
<p>Can <cite>music21</cite> read in music directly from an image or a .pdf?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Sorry, that&#8217;s beyond <cite>music21</cite>&#8216;s capabilities. This technology
is called OMR (Optical Music Recognition) and it&#8217;s a whole separate
field of research in itself.  Audiveris is an open-source OMR
software toolkit.  The development team here has had good experience
with the commercial SmartScore application.  <cite>Music21</cite> does have a
good set of modules for improving the output of OMR after it&#8217;s done.
See <a class="reference internal" href="../moduleReference/moduleOmrCorrectors.html#moduleomrcorrectors"><span class="std std-ref">music21.omr.correctors</span></a>.</div></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m ready to give it a try, but how do I install <cite>music21</cite>?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Please see the complete install instructions:
<a class="reference internal" href="../usersGuide/usersGuide_01_installing.html#usersguide-01-installing"><span class="std std-ref">User&#8217;s Guide, Chapter 1: Installing music21</span></a>.</div></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m using Linux/GNU/Unix and I&#8217;m having trouble configuring <cite>music21</cite>, can
you help?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Unfortunately, due to the number of different flavors of open-source
operating systems, the development team can only give free help to
Mac and Windows installation. (but see paid support, below).</div></blockquote>
<p><cite>Music21</cite> doesn&#8217;t have some feature that I need, how do I get it added?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It won&#8217;t hurt to email the list (or us directly) and we&#8217;ll consider it.
However, we do have a priority list based on what we think the widest
audience will require or what we need for our own research.  If you&#8217;d
like your request to leap-frog to the front of the line, the best way
is to endow the programming of your feature through a donation that will
enable us to increase the number of student programming assistants we
employ.  (Or side-step us and offer a cash bounty on the music21list
itself).</div></blockquote>
<p>No, you don&#8217;t understand, I <strong>really</strong> need this feature!</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If you really need something done in <cite>music21</cite>, we offer paid support
by the hour at standard consulting rates. Discounts are available for
academic researchers/composers who consider the feature so essential as to add
authorship credit to the development team. Contact <cite>cuthbert&#64;mit.edu</cite>
for details and rates.</div></blockquote>

<p>What is MusicXML?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>MusicXML is a file format for exchanging musical scores among different
programs, such as, oh...`music21` and Finale (or <cite>music21</cite> and Sibelius,
or Dorico, or MuseScore).
It was created and owned by Recordare (Michael Good, CEO). More
information about the project can be found at:</p>

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And this Humdrum about which you speak?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It&#8217;s another framework for studying music as symbolic data using
simple text files and UNIX scripting tools.  Created by David Huron
in the 80s and 90s. We&#8217;re big fans of Humdrum
here at <cite>music21</cite>, but we thought that it was time to take a
different approach.</p>
<p>Information on Humdrum can be found here at the following links:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum">http://music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum</a></li>

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s Lilypond?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It&#8217;s an open-source package for displaying music, sort of like
Finale and Sibelius, but with different goals and a different
approach (and it&#8217;s free!).  If you have Lilypond installed,
music21 can output to lilypond by using &#8220;show(&#8216;lily.png&#8217;)&#8221; or &#8220;show(&#8216;lily.pdf&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p>More information on the Lilypond can be found here at the following links:</p>
