.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute instance\-groups managed resize\fR resize a managed instance
group to a provided size.

If you resize down, the Instance Group Manager service deletes instances from
the group until the group reaches the desired size. To understand in what order
instances will be deleted, see the API documentation.

If you resize up, the service adds instances to the group using the current
instance template until the group reaches the desired size.
