.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud components restore \- restore the Cloud SDK installation to its previous state



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud components restore\fR [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This is an undo operation, which restores the Cloud SDK installation on the
local workstation to the state it was in just before the most recent \f5gcloud
components update\fR, \f5gcloud components remove\fR, or \f5gcloud components
install\fR command. Only the state before the most recent such state is
remembered, so it is impossible to restore the state that existed before the two
most recent \f5update\fR commands, for example. A \f5restore\fR command does not
undo a previous \f5restore\fR command.



.SH "GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS"

These flags are available to all commands: \-\-account, \-\-configuration,
\-\-flatten, \-\-format, \-\-help, \-\-log\-http, \-\-project, \-\-quiet,
\-\-trace\-token, \-\-user\-output\-enabled, \-\-verbosity. Run \fB$ gcloud
help\fR for details.
